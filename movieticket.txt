One normal movie ticket costs 100 SEK, and for minors under 18 years, the price is 50 SEK. If the performance starts before 18:00, there is an additional 10% discount.

Implement the function movieTickets(nrTickets,nrUnder18,time), which takes the number of tickets, the number of people under 18 and the starting and returns the total price for all tickets. For example movieTickets(5,3,17) should return 315.

def movieTickets(nrTickets,nrUnder18,time):
  ticketadult =(nrTickets-nrUnder18)*100
  ticketUnder18 =nrUnder18*50
  if nrUnder18!=0 and time<18:
    discount=((ticketadult+ticketUnder18)*10)/100
  else:
    discount=0
  return (ticketadult+ticketUnder18)-discount

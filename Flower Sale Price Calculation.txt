Flower Sale Price Calculation
A flower shop sells each flower for 20 SEK. They have two different types of discounts:

Spring Sale: During weeks 14 to 17, there's a "Buy 1, Get 1 Free" offer — i.e., two flowers for the price of one.
Bulk Discount: If a customer buys 200 or more flowers at once, they receive a 20% discount.
However, these two discounts cannot be combined. The customer should always receive the better (i.e., cheaper) of the two deals.

Define a function main() that:

Asks the user for the number of flowers they want to buy.
Asks for the current week number.
Outputs the total price the customer needs to pay.
Input:
Number of flowers (int)
Week number (int)
Inputs must be read from the console, not passed to main as parameters.

Output:
Print the minimum price to be paid based on the applicable offer.
Example runs
>>> Number of flowers: 10
>>> Week number: 1
The price is 200
>>> Number of flowers: 5
>>> Week number: 15
The price is 60
>>> Number of flowers: 250
>>> Week number: 17
The price is 2500

Rugby Game Points
In rugby, a team can score points in four different ways:

A try is worth 5 points.
A conversion is worth 2 points, but can only be attempted if a try has been scored.
A penalty is worth 3 points.
A drop goal is also worth 3 points.
Your task is to define a function main() to compute the total number of game points based on user info about the number of tries, conversions, penalties, and drop goals a team has scored. Additionally, a conversion can only be attempted if a try is scored. If the number of conversions exceeds the number of tries, the input is invalid and should trigger an error message.

Input:
Number of tries (tries)
Number of conversions (conversions)
Number of penalties (penalties)
Number of drop goals (drop_goals)
Inputs must be read from the console, not passed to main as parameters.

Output:
All output should be printed with print, not returned as the result of the function.

The total points scored by the team if valid input is provided.
An error message if the number of conversions exceeds the number of tries.
Example runs
>>> Number of tries? 3
>>> Number of conversions? 2
>>> Number of penalties? 4
>>> Number of drop goals? 0
Game points: 31
>>> Number of tries? 2
>>> Number of conversions? 3
Impossible: too many conversions or too few tries.
Note that the program is expected to exit early if an input error occurs.

Look for <-- Likely cause of exception in the output if an exception occured.

# Expected output in normal case for n game points: "Game points: n"
def main():
  Numtries=int(input("Number of tries?"))
  Numconversion=int(input("Number of conversions?"))
  
# Expected output in case of conversion error: "Impossible: too many conversions or too few tries." 
  if Numconversion > Numtries:
      print("Impossible: too many conversions or too few tries.")
      return

  Penalties=int(input("Number of penalties?"))
  DropGoals=int(input("Number of drop goals?"))
  
  if(Numtries >= 0):  
    Gamepoints=(Numtries*5)+(Numconversion*2)+(Penalties*3)+(DropGoals*3)
  else:
    Gamepoints=(Numconversion*2)+(Penalties*3)+(DropGoals*3)
  print("Game points:", Gamepoints)
  
#print(f"inputs[{Numtries},{Numconversion},{Penalties},{DropGoals}] is Game points: {Gamepoints}")


main()
